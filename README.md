# News and Job Aggregator

In this project I created a news and job aggregator which basically is an application which scraps news and jobs from multiple websites such as iharare and pindula.
After this information has been saved in the database I then created an API which allows for other developers to be able to work with this data.
They can perform all the GET, POST and PUT requests on the data.
This application was created to save users from moving from one website to another searching for news and jobs, rather they can view all that information on one website.
